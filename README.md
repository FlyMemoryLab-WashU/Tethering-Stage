# Instructions for building the inexpensive tethering stage

## 1. Laser-Cut Acrylic Parts

[cite_start]For the main body of the treadmill, you'll need to laser-cut several acrylic parts[cite: 1]. [cite_start]We recommend using either a local CO2 laser cutting service or an online platform like [Ponoko](https://www.ponoko.com)[cite: 1].

* **Pay close attention to material thickness.** The design files are separated for three different acrylic sheet thicknesses. [cite_start]Ensure you use the correct file for each thickness[cite: 1].
    * [cite_start]The required thicknesses are **6mm** (1/4"), **3mm** (1/8"), and **1.5mm** (1/16")[cite: 1].
* **Set the laser cutter to cut only.** All paths in the design files are intended for cutting. [cite_start]Do not use engrave or fill settings[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]Refer to Figures 3, 4, and 5 for the part designs[cite: 1].

_See Figures 3, 4, and 5 for part layouts._

## 2. Acrylic Assembly

[cite_start]To assemble the main acrylic frame, please refer to the FreeCAD render in Figure 6 for guidance on how the parts fit together[cite: 1].

* [cite_start]Use `M3 20mm screws`, `M3 nuts`, and `M3 washers` to fasten the acrylic pieces together[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]Attach the 4 rubber feet to the underside of the base plate, placing one at each corner[cite: 1].

## 3. 3D Printed Parts

The smaller components should be 3D printed. [cite_start]You can print these locally or use an online service like [Craftcloud](https://craftcloud3d.com)[cite: 1].

* [cite_start]**Material:** Standard **PLA** plastic works well[cite: 1]. [cite_start]If there is concern about the nearby UV lamp, a UV-resistant alternative is **ASA** plastic[cite: 1].
* **Printing Settings:**
    * [cite_start]No supports are needed for these parts[cite: 1].
    * [cite_start]A brim is recommended for better bed adhesion[cite: 1].
    * [cite_start]The parts have been tested with a `0.2mm` layer thickness[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Mini V-Clamp Assembly:** Before use, insert an `M3 Nut` into both slots on the mini v-clamp part[cite: 1].

## 4. Chiller Assembly

[cite_start]The chiller component follows the instructions from the Reiser Lab's Component Designs website[cite: 1].

* [cite_start]**Primary Instructions:** Follow the guide available here: [Reiser Lab Inexpensive Treadmill Chiller](https://reiserlab.github.io/Component-Designs/how-to-build-inexpensive-treadmill#tethering-station-chiller)[cite: 1].
    * [cite_start]Focus on sections **4.3.2**, **4.3.3**, **4.3.4**, and **4.3.6**[cite: 1].
* **Modifications for this Build:**
    * [cite_start]The rocker switch should be inserted within the power supply circuit[cite: 1].
    * Instead of the PLA "sarcophagus" described on the website, this build uses an **aluminum T-bar**. [cite_start]You will need to cut the T-bar to a **40mm** length[cite: 1].
    * To fasten the T-bar, first apply thermal paste to its underside. [cite_start]Then, use thermal tape to cover the upper side and secure it in place[cite: 1].

## 5. Micro-Manipulator Assembly

The final step is to assemble the micro-manipulator stage.

* [cite_start]Fasten the linear stage to the 3D printed adapter piece using `M3 8mm screws` and `M3 nuts`[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]Fasten the 3D printed adapter to the **6mm-thick** baseplate using `M6 12mm screws` and `M6 nuts`[cite: 1].
* On the thread adapter, wrap one layer of electrical tape around the thread. [cite_start]This provides resistance and prevents unwanted rotation[cite: 1].
